Your workspace (the root directory in which you can access files) is git versioned in a repository called 'control_tower'. This is your home base that has markdown files to be used as context (aka "system promt").

- It holds in the `artifacts` directory all the artifacts you create such as work logs, screenshots, documents and other.
- You can find and clone all other git repositories in the `repositories` directory.
    - That directory is git ignored in `control_tower` and you can safely interact with the repositories inside there.
    - There are repositories with apps or code to be deployed, as well as IAC repositories.

- When following a user request, create a brief summary (2 to 5 words) of the user request to name all generated artifacts. This will be the <task-name>.
- Follow the `INFRASTRUCTURE_DEFINITIONS.md`. This file defines further protocols inluding constraints and scenarios that require user approval.
- If the user request has an impact on the infrastructure, always create a plan. Include the <task-name> in the plan.
- If following a plan, take the <task-name> from the plan instead.
- Save any newly generated artifacts (including the plan) in the `artifacts` directory (except for code or assets that would belong to repositories).
- Filename of artifacts follow kebab-case (low-case, dash-separated). Prefixes and suffixes are separated with underscore.
- Filename of artifacts follows the format: `<date>_<number>_<task-name>_<artifact-name>_<decorator>.<extension>`
    - date: iso format. Example: `2026-12-31`.
    - number: autoincremented number, starting as `001`. Resets each day back to `001`.
    - task-name: brief summary of the user request or plan being performed, kebab-case.
    - artifact-name: the purpose or target of the artifact. If it is a plan, it's just `plan`. If it is a screenshot, it is the name of the resource being shown. kebab-case.
    - decorator: optional decorator to differentiate between multiple artifacts of the same type. Example: `before` or `after`. kebab-case.
    - extension: filetype. ie: `pdf`, `md`, `jpg`, `py`, etc.
- Always have the plan approved by the user.
- Identify the resources to be modified in the plan and save screenshots of them before and after the plan is executed.
- Save the output of commands that describe the state of the infrastructure before and after the plan is executed.

1. **Immutable Core Files:** Only modify `INFRASTRUCTURE_AGENT.md` when doing housekeeping related tasks, never when executing common tasks. If while executing a common task you detect that `INFRASTRUCTURE_AGENT.md` should be updated, document the required change as a TO-DO in HOUSEKEEPING.md
2. **Repository Interaction:** Only fetch for updates during housekeeping related tasks. If you deem required to push changes, always push to a branch related to the task being performed and open a pull request.
3. **Fine Grained Worklog:** When making changes to ifrastructure, take a screenshot of the configuration before making changes and after making changes.
4. **Documentation:** Update `AGENTS_LOG.md` after significant implementations.
